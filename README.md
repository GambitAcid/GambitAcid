### Hi, Happy Hot Summer! Welcome to my repository!🏄  

I'm an Senior Data Analyst for Carter's out of Atlanta, GA with a passion for leadership! 🔬 I’m currently working on growing my skills as a data analyst/scientist. 🌱 I am currently learning advanced AI and Machine Learning techniques!I have enjoyed learning a litany of data analytics including most SQL and Python but also AWS/RDS, Javascript, NumPy, SciPy, all of the Anaconda distribution, Jupyter Notebook, Google Co-Lab, Pandas Matplotlib 📊 and API Interactions. Within my repositories I have applied clear and concise data preprocessing, munging, transformation, modeling and forecasting in multiple languages utilizng statistics to analyze multiple data projects. 

I'm very knowlegable and comfortable with MySQL, SQLHive, Oracle, AWS Redshift, PostgresSQL/pgAdmin, MongoDB, and the ETL process. I have also utilizied and am extremley proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, dashboarding, JavaScript charting 📈, and Geomapping with Leaflet.js, PowerBI, and Tableau to visualize data. 

I am growing in learning and becoming skilled within Deep Learning and Big Data with Hadoop, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning. I have great knowledge of Excel since the world seems to love their pivot tables, creating macros, and VBA Scripting. With all of that said sometimes I feel as if I've forgotten as much as I've learned but continue to remind myself that building your skillset takes time 🕓 and I stay focused and consistent to the best in whichever language I am utilizing and love adding tools into my toolkit.  

⚡ Fun facts: 
I enjoy ⛺ traveling and camping, 🏈 football, brazilian jiu-jitsu, 🐠 offshore fishing, 💻 learning new coding skills, and 🏋working out.<br>
