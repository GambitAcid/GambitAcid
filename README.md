### Hi there 👋

I'm an analyst and biologist with a passion for leadership! 🔭 I’m currently working on growing my skills as a data analyst/scientist. 🌱 I have enjoyed learning Python, NumPy, SciPy, all of Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Google Co-Lab, Pandas Matplotlib 📊 and API Interactions. Within my repositories I have applied modeling and forecasting in multiple languages utilizng statistics to analyze multiple data projects. I'm very knowlegable and comfortable with PostgresSQL/pgAdmin, MongoDB, and ETL. I have utilizied and am extremley proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,  dashboarding, JavaScript charting 📈, and Geomapping with Leaflet.js, PowerBI, and Tableau to visualize data. I am growing in learning and becoming skilled within Amazons AWS & RDS,  R Programming, deploying with Heroku, Big Data Analytics with Hadoop, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, as well as Deep Learning. I have great knowledge of Excel since the world seems to love their pivot tables, creating macros, and VBA Scripting.  With all of that said sometimes I feel as if I've forgotten as much as I've learned but continue to remind myself that building your skillset takes 🕓 and I stay focused and consistent to the best in wahtever language I am utilizing.  

⚡ Fun facts: 
I enjoy ⛺ traveling and camping, brazilian jiu-jitsu, offshore fishing, and building my 4x4, and 🏋working out.
